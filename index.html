        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Gwen Gibbes and I am an elementary school teacher. I have been teaching for 18 years and have taught all grades from Grade 1 to 11. I am currently teaching grade 3 and have been doing so exclusively online for the last 2 years. This past March was the 2 year anniversary of online teaching. It has been so different from anything I had ever experienced prior to online teaching.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-5">
        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>Until recently I thought I would teach forever and while I may still, I have felt it was time to learn a new
      skill. My current goal is to learn enough about coding and web design to properly understand how to code a
      website. I want to be able to create efficient and appealing websites. I would like to understand how to turn this new knowledge into a career.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md my-5">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in constantly learning and evolving. Keeping up with the ever-changing world is something that fascinates me. I am always in awe of the new things, both positive and negative, that we can learn. I am also interested in the environment and making sure that we take care of the Earth that we live on.</p>

          <strong>Animals</strong>
          <p>My hobbies are outdoor adventures and anything to do with animals. I absolutely adore animals and over the
            2 years that we were locked down due to Covid, our family adopted a cat. He found us really. His name was
            Squeak and he appeared on our porch one evening. He made our home his for 9 months and I like to believe
            that even though he was a feral cat, he really loved staying with us.</p>
